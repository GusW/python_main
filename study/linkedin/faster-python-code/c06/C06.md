# Chapter 6 - Parallel Computing

## Amdahl's Law

Theoretical limits of speed increase or latency as a result of parallel computing
S(N) = 1 / ((1-P) + (P/N))

1. I/O-Bound
   1. Network, disk
2. CPU-Bound
   1. Calculations

| Option    | Details                                |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Threads   | I/O-bound                              |
| Processes | CPU-bound (Not a lot of communication) |
| asyncio   | Many connections, have async drivers   |

## Threads

- Share the same memory
- Python data structures are not thread safe
- Most Python programs are single thread
- Newer Python versions include concurrent.futures

```bash
ipython

# interactive mode
%run c06/l01_thr_pool.py

%time users_info(logins)
# When CPU time is extremely small compared to wall time we can make use of threads

%prun -l 20 users_info(logins)

%time users_info_thr(logins)
```

## Processes

- Allow utilization of all cores
- Cost to use processes in communication requires inter-process communication (IPC)

```bash
ipython

# interactive mode
%run c06/l02_proc_pool.py

%time _ = unpack(requests)
# When CPU time is compared to wall time we can make use of processes

%time _ = unpack_proc(requests)
```

## asyncio

- Some scenarios require too many threads or processes to be effective
- If I/O-bound, asyncio (asynchronous input/output) is an option
- Uses cooperative multitasking

```bash
ipython

# interactive mode
%run c06/l03_gh_user.py

%time _ = users_info(logins)

%run c06/l03_gh_user_aio.py

%time _ = users_info_aio(logins)
```
