# Chapter 8 - Adding Optimization to Your Process

## Process

- Serves the group (sometimes at the expense of the individual)
- Focuses on process related to optimization
- Protects against surprises
- Every team has its own specific, customized process
- Process should be continually improved upon

## Design and Code Review

- Easier to fix problems in design phase than in production
- Use a checkist
  - What are the performance restrictions?
  - How will performance be measured?
  - Can any code be removed?
  - Are there too many components?
  - Is there too much serialization in the code?
  - Are the right algorithms and data structures used?
- Checklist for Code Review

## Benchmarks

- Jenkins is a populat CI system to run test suites with when code is changed
- Benchmarks should be added to code, and results of benchmarks should be saved
- pytest-benchmark allows tests that are benchmarks, and the results can be published to JSON files

```bash

pytest c08/ --benchmark-autosave

pytest c08/ --benchmark-autosave --benchmark-compare
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

- Even with benchmarks and reviews in place, bugs and performance issues will still occasionally slip into production

```bash
ipython

%run c08/l02_timed.py

add(3,4)
```
