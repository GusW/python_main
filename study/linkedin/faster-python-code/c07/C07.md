# Chapter 7 - Beyond Python

## Numpy

- Provides a matrix data type called an array and a set of mathematical functions
- Written in super-optimized C
- Base for most of the Python scientific stack
- Uses machine-level numbers (different from Python numbers)

```bash
ipython

# interactive mode
2**1000

import numpy as np

np.int64(2)**1000

%run c07/l01_np.py

vec = list(range(1_000_000))

%timeit vmul(vec, vec)

vec1 = np.array(vec)

%timeit vec1 * vec1

from math import sin

%timeit [sin(v) for v in vec1]

%timeit np.sin(vec1)
```

## Numba

- Python is a dynamic interpreted language
- Language-level optimization is difficult
- JIT (just in time compilation)
  - Information about the code collected at run time and specific machine code is generated from this information
- Numba
  - External project that uses a JIT compiler called LLVM which generates machine code for Python functions

```bash
ipython

# interactive mode
%run c07/l02_jit.py

poly(coeffs, 7)

%timeit poly(coeffs, 7)

poly_j(coeffs, 7)

%timeit poly_j(coeffs, 7)

```

## Cython

- Some scenatios require rewriting of parts of Python in C
- Writing C with Python API can be chalenging
- Cython is middle-ground approach that offers good performance and enjoyable coding experience
  - Superset of Python - it's Python, plus types and connections to C libraries
  - Written as `.pyx` files
  - C compiler required

```bash
ipython

# interactive mode
%run c07/l03_sqrt.py

sqrt(2)

%timeit sqrt(2)
# interactive mode off

python c07/l03_setup.py build_ext -i

ipython

# interactive mode
from l03_cysqrt import sqrt

sqrt(2)

%timeit sqrt(2)
```

## PyPy

- Other implementations of Python include Jython (Java) and IronPython (.NET)
- PyPy is written in Python
  - Includes a JIT compiler
  - Latest vesions has improved compatibility with 3rd-party modules

```bash
# on default interpreter
ipython

# interactive mode
%run c07/l04_fib.py

%timeit fib(1000)

# on PyPy interpreter
# interactive mode
%run c07/l04_fib.py

%timeit fib(1000)

```

## C extensions

- C is usually the most performant language to improve speed of code
- Explore C extensions if other options failed
- Python C API is well documented and flexible
- No automatic memory management in C

```bash
python c07/l05_setup.py build_ext -i

ipython

# interactive mode
%run c07/l05_sqrt.py

%timeit sqrt(2)

from l05_csqrt import sqrt

%timeit sqrt(2)
```
