# Introduction to Dynamic Programming

## Divide and Conquer

## Dynamic Programming

### Recursive

- Repeats same computation many times

### Memoization

- Normally implementation of a cache (hashmap)
- It potentially increases memory usage.
- Tradeoff time complexity by space complexity

### Bottom-up

All Directed Acyclic Graphs are linearizable, making it possible to solve the subproblems in order of dependency.
