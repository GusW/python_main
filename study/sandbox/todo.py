Given an integer, re-arrange the integer such that first and last digit will be at first and second, second
and second last digit will be at third and fourth position from left of the re-arranges integer and so on.
Example:
Input -> 12345678, Output -> 18273645
Input -> 1234567, Output -> 1726354

Given an array with n integers, check if it could become non-decreasing by removing at most 1 element.
Example:
Input: [3, 2, 4, 3], Output: false
Input: [1, 4, 2, 3], Output: true
Input: [4, 3, 2], Output: false
Input: [1, 2, 3], Output: true

"""
Determine whether a circular array with magic indexes contains a full circle. The array is circular in the sense that,
the entry A[i] points to entry A[A[i]]. Full circle means it covers all the elements of the array.
As a follow-up, I was asked to solve the problem in O(1) space.
Example:
Input: [2, 3, 1, 4, 0], Output: true
Input: [2, 3, 2, 4, 9], Output: false
